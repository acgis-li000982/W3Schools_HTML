✅ Use GitHub Pages (100% free, super easy, perfect for WebGIS)
GitHub Pages lets you host HTML + CSS + JavaScript files for free.
That means you can publish your Leaflet, Mapbox, or ArcGIS JS API map in minutes.
And yes — people can visit it like a real website:
https://yourusername.github.io/your-map/
Let me walk you through it step by step.

✅ Step 1 — Create a GitHub account
Go to:
https://github.com
Make an account if you don’t already have one.

✅ Step 2 — Create a new repository
Name it something like:
webgis-map
Important:
Make it Public
Check “Add a README” (optional but helpful)

✅ Step 3 — Upload your WebGIS files
Upload:
index.html
style.css (optional)
script.js (optional)
any images or data files
If your map is a single HTML file, just upload that.

✅ Step 4 — Enable GitHub Pages
Go to: Settings → Pages
Then:
Under Source, choose main branch
Set folder to /root
Click Save
GitHub will generate a public URL like:
https://yourusername.github.io/webgis-map/
Your map is now live on the internet.

✅ Step 5 — Visit your WebGIS map
Open the URL GitHub gives you.
You now have a publicly accessible WebGIS app.
You can send the link to anyone — it works like a real website.
